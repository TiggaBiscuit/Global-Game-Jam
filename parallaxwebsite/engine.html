        “The Engine room? You think I should go there?” She asked nervously. “These corridors used to be filled with familiar sounds
        and smells, but now it’s a cold empty void like the surrounding space. . . humph here it is the engine room” You
        hear the sound of air as the pressurised room sucks in oxygen and the slight groan of struggle as Kate keeps here
        ground it’s open.” Let’s have a look at this engine huh. . . “You hear clanging and some mumble swears under Kates
        breath” “Only seems to have slipped a plate nothing too technical thankfully, this really isn’t my thing. Now where
        are these tools”

        won’t feel like I’m top of mount Everest anymore. do you think I should keep hold of this wrench? I mean I am in
        unknown territory. Should I take it?”
